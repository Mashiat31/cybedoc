# # Victim Demographic
# We conducted the survey with a target of achieving a 100 responses. We got 92 so far. Nevertheless, the responses were enough for us to get answers to the questions we were asking about cyber harassment in Bangladesh. The very first thing we wanted to see was the gender of the respondents i.e. which of the genders clicks on the survey more and takes it. The survey was meant to take around 10 mins to be filled if one were to write the whole description. So we figured the ratio would be pretty intriguing. Here's what we found:

import plotly

labels = ['Male', 'Female', 'Prefer not to say']
values = [29.3, 66.3, 15]
plotly.tools.set_credentials_file(username='Mashiat', api_key='JiJVspFlv6WLlvs1o1wi')
trace = go.Pie(labels=labels, values=values)

py.iplot([trace], filename='basic_pie_chart7')



# Furthermore, we realized we needed to know the age demographic of the demographics. Whether the respondee was harassed or not, we wanted to see what age of people approached the survey. Not so surprisingly, around 65% belonged to the age group between 14 and 20 i.e adolescents.

import plotly

labels = ['36 and up', '21-26', '37-35', '14-20']
values = [1, 35, 2, 65]
plotly.tools.set_credentials_file(username='Mashiat', api_key='JiJVspFlv6WLlvs1o1wi')
trace = go.Pie(labels=labels, values=values)

py.iplot([trace], filename='basic_pie_chart2')


# # Something we often see being talked about is what cyber harassment is in the eyes of both the victims and the harassers. We asked our respondents the same question. Even though our hypothesis was that most people would go with "uploading someone's pictures/manipulating them", majority actually voted for any sort of threatening/blackmailing done online. Manipulation of pictures came second and this shows us that cyber harassment can be varied. It doesn't always have to be set within a particular list of incidents.
